This campaign is set in the world of "the adventurers guild" (the book series)

Main premise:
	50 years after Foster's ritual, the city of Freestone is still recovering, and is starting to settle in with he concept of guilds. 

Story:
	Foster is a "misunderstood genius" to the current mages guild. They believe that his ritual had the potential to change the world for the better, he just drew upon the wrong plane. Their plan is to reenact the ritual, this time targeting [[Planes#Lux]], the plane of order. This is a **terrible** decision. Blinded by their egos, the mages guild would try and "fix" what foster did by redoing the ritual, supposedly undoing the day of dangers, and bringing about world order. The adventurers guild realizes what's happening and tries to stop them.

Arc One:
	The adventurers guild is sent out on a resource gathering mission to gather materials to "strengthen the wards". They figure this is a routine scavenging mission, so they send out some newer recruits along with a veteran to keep them safe. They go to [[Foster's ruins]] (they don't know that's what they are), and go through a mini-dungeon to grab a runestone, one of the pieces needed for the ritual. All is going fine and dandy until they get to the runestone, and feel something *unnatural* about it. It seems to be giving off faint hints of the plane [[Planes#Nox]]. This hopefully warrants a bit of caution and distrust, aimed towards the mages guild. When they go in to grab it, [[The Apostles of Foster]] show up, do some dialogue, and then depending on the players choice, fight or hand over the stone. The players can handle this peacefully, by persuading the apostles into believing they come on the behalf of the mages guild (they themselves are deceiving the guild into believing that the ritual will heal the world). The party returns and are debriefed by the mages guild, notably without [[Roult]]. 
	This arc ends with the party being placed under "quarantine".
