## Outside
The ruins look almost like a mini keep, something akin to a wizard's tower, but with signs of wear. Ivy growing along the tower, and crumbling bricks. It seems as if no one has been here in many years. (about 30). 
#### Unusual features
there seems to be an absence of dust, and no living matter but the vines growing along the sides. It seems as if there is an area around the tower, with about a 10 ft radius of nothing but dirt and grass. It doesn't seem unnatural, just unusual that there are no shrubberies or trees. 
#### Tower
There is two doors, one leading in through what seems to be a ditch in the ground, presumably a cellar door, and one leading in through what looks like the main entrance.
